Considerably more information is available at the DataExpress website:

Compiling from source: The source code includes both a Maven pom.xml file and an SBT build.sbt configuration allowing
either Maven or SBT to be used for building. Why both? User choice naturally. However, SBT is the preferred choice as
it provides better support for scala test integration. 

All  commands assume you are working in the dataexpress root directory, here ~/dataexpress) 
//Using SBT (assumes SBT 0.11.2)
1. Download the source to a local project directory, here assume it is ~/dataexpress

2. Ensure SBT is installed see http://www.scala-sbt.org/

3. To compile current source code:
$sbt compile

4. To test current source code:
$sbt test

5. To package WITHOUT dependencies
$sbt package

6. To package WITH dependencies (does not include Scala library, to do so in ~/dataexpress/build.sbt set assembleArtifact in packageScala := true
$sbt assembly

7. To create scaladocs
$sbt doc

8. To start a Scala console with DataExpress on the class path
$sbt console
-Note this will also automatically perform the following imports
import edu.chop.cbmi.dataExpress.dsl.ETL._
import edu.chop.cbmi.dataExpress.dsl.ETL
import edu.chop.cbmi.dataExpress.dsl.stores.SqlDb
import edu.chop.cbmi.dataExpress.dataModels.RichOption._

//Using MAVEN
1. Download the source to a local project directory, here assume it is ~/dataexpress

2. Ensure Apache Maven is installed see http://maven.apache.org/

3. To compile current source code: 
$mvn clean compile

4. To test current source code: 
$mvn test-compile
-Then run scalatest using any of the methods provided at http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/running_your_tests

5. To package current source code with dependencies
$mvn -Ppackage-with-dependencies package
