# Getting Involved and Contributing
DataExpress has humble beginnings but grand ambitions. We want to engage with those of you who, like us, tired of hacking together the same kinds of one-off scritps, tired of using expensive BI tools and annoyed GUI's that force you to draw hundreds of lines to generate XML by the terabyte just to copy some tables. We can't do this without a community of like-minded people. We need people who know data, specific database implementations, and Scala. We want people who value simplicity instead of over-engineering. Help us simplify ETL for everyone.

* We would love a pull request from you!
* Visit the [dataexpress-etl](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dataexpress-etl) google group and see what ideas people are kicking around (this is new so there might not be any yet!)
* Take a look at the [open tickets](https://github.com/cbmi/dataexpress/issues?state=open) we have against the project
* All long-term development is done against the develop branch or a feature branch off of develop.
* We're still adjusting to this whole community development model, please check with us before embarking on a major coding endeavor in the event that oen of us is already contemplating it. Use the google group or github issues so everyone can see the exchage.
* Tests are a bit problematic for a project like this, primarily because it's hard to use things like Travis-ci to test the builds against proprietary databases (I'm looking at you Oracle and SQLServer). We want to make this easier, so if you've got some way to help with that, that would make the project better for everyone.
